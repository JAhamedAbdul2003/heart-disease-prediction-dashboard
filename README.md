📊 Dashboard Project – Internship Task 2 (Power BI)

An interactive Power BI dashboard built as part of my second task for the Data Analytics Internship at Dynamix Network.
This project follows a complete analytics workflow — from importing and cleaning a Kaggle dataset to creating a structured, insight-driven dashboard.

📊 Project Overview

The objective of this project was to take a raw dataset from Kaggle and convert it into a usable, interactive Power BI report.
The dashboard focuses on revealing key insights related to the dataset’s structure, patterns, and metrics through clean visual design.

🧩 Key Features

Cleaned and transformed raw data using Power Query

Built multiple interactive visuals (charts, cards, KPIs, etc.)

Added slicers and filters for dynamic, user-driven insights

Structured a clear and consistent dashboard layout

Applied data types, formatting, and model adjustments for smooth filtering

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI – Dashboard creation & visualization

Power Query – Data cleaning & transformation

Kaggle Dataset – Source data

DAX – Basic calculations (where needed)

📈 Outcome

A fully functional Power BI dashboard that allows users to explore the dataset interactively, uncover trends, compare values, and analyze the data from multiple angles.
The project strengthens skills in data preparation, modeling, and visualization.
